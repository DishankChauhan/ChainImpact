# ChainImpact Project Status

This document outlines the current status of the ChainImpact platform, what's working, what needs improvement, and next steps.

## Current Status

ChainImpact is currently a **functional MVP** that demonstrates the core concept and functionality of a blockchain-based donation platform.

### What's Working ‚úÖ

1. **User Authentication**
   - Email/password signup and login
   - User profiles with basic information
   - Firebase integration for user management

2. **Campaign Management**
   - Create campaigns with title, description, goal amount
   - View campaign details
   - Add milestones to campaigns
   - Campaign listing with search functionality

3. **Wallet Integration**
   - Connect Phantom wallet
   - View wallet balance
   - Request devnet SOL airdrop

4. **UI/UX**
   - Responsive design
   - Modern interface with shadcn/ui components
   - Dashboard for users to track donations and campaigns

5. **Basic Donation Flow**
   - Send SOL to campaign wallets
   - Record donations in Firebase
   - Update campaign totals

6. **Notifications**
   - Basic notification system for donations and milestone updates

### What's Partially Working üü°

1. **Smart Contract Integration**
   - Basic contract structure is in place
   - Needs deployment to devnet for full functionality
   - Currently using simulated transactions in some cases

2. **Milestone Verification**
   - Basic verification UI is implemented
   - Oracle integration is simulated but not connected to real oracles
   - Milestone status tracking works

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Basic notification system is in place
   - Needs more comprehensive real-time updates

### What's Missing ‚ùå

1. **Production-ready Smart Contract**
   - Current implementation needs security auditing
   - Escrow functionality needs testing
   - Error handling needs improvement

2. **Real Oracle Integration**
   - Currently using simulated verification
   - Needs integration with real oracle services like Chainlink

3. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - More test coverage needed
   - End-to-end testing required
   - Performance testing under load

## Is it Ready for Submission to Superteam?

The application is a **functional MVP** that demonstrates the core concept and functionality of a blockchain-based donation platform. However, before submitting to Superteam, we recommend:

1. **Deploy the smart contract to devnet** - This is critical to demonstrate the blockchain integration
2. **Test the full donation flow** - Ensure funds are properly handled in the escrow account
3. **Add more comprehensive error handling** - Especially for blockchain transactions
4. **Improve the documentation** - Add more detailed setup instructions and user guides

## Next Steps to Complete the MVP

1. **Smart Contract Deployment**
   - Deploy the Rust program to Solana devnet
   - Update the frontend to use the deployed contract address
   - Test all contract interactions

2. **Oracle Integration**
   - Research and implement a basic oracle solution
   - Connect milestone verification to the oracle
   - Test the verification flow

3. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - Add more unit tests
   - Perform end-to-end testing
   - Fix any bugs or issues

4. **Documentation and Demo**
   - Complete user documentation
   - Create a demo video
   - Prepare presentation materials

5. **Security Audit**
   - Review smart contract for vulnerabilities
   - Implement security best practices
   - Test edge cases and error handling

## Timeline Estimate

| Task | Estimated Time |
|------|----------------|
| Smart Contract Deployment | 1-2 days |
| Oracle Integration | 2-3 days |
| Testing and QA | 2-3 days |
| Documentation and Demo | 1-2 days |
| Security Audit | 2-3 days |

Total estimated time to complete MVP: **8-13 days**
